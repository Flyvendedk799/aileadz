1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,937
I was saying

2
00:00:00,937 --> 00:00:01,874
this in January

3
00:00:01,874 --> 00:00:02,811
and I was

4
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:03,748
like damn I

5
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:04,685
think he about

6
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:05,622

7
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:06,559
come back

8
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:07,530
I'm not trying to

9
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,500
be funny and I'm

10
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,470
not trying to be

11
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,439
dramatic, but low key

12
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,400
I think I think

13
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,359
it might be on

14
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,320

15
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,279

16
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,199
It says the

17
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,160
Trump administration cut

18
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,120
a clause from

19
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,079
federal contracting rules

20
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,039
that had been

21
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,000
on the books

22
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,960
since the 1960s

23
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,280
Companies are

24
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,239

27
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,120
segregated facilities
